## **CIA triad**

- c => who can see it
- i => is it right
- a => when can i access

### Confidentiality / who can see

- prevents leaking to unauthorized entities
- 3 pillars | possible protection measures
  - authentication = who can do something ?
  - authorization = what can someone do ?
  - accounting | non-repudiation (onweerlegbaarheid) = who did something ?

>  possible solutions: can be obtained via **encryption** / **authentication** and **access control** (to prevent unauthorized access to networks / computers / data etc...)

### Integrity / is it right ? 

- **preciseness** / **consistency** / **reliability** of data during it's existence

>  possible solutions: can be obtained via **hashing** / **data validity checks** / **data consistency checks** / **access controls**
>
> **integrity check** = way to check if a collection of data is still valid often via a hashing function

### Availability

- information has to be available at any moment

**always online systems** 3 pillars :

- avoid single points of failure
- ensure reliable transition systems
- detect as malfunctions soon as they occur

> possible solutions : can be protected via **redundantie**, **backups**, **verhoogdeweerstand**, **onderhoud**, **up-to-date software en OS**, noodplannen om terug online te komen na een onvoorziene omstandigheid, use new technology, detect unusual activity ,availability tests
